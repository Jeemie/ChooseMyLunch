## ChooseMyLunch

[Link to try!](https://www.mylunch.glitch.me "Choose my lunch!")

This is a project made in my free time using express.js on glitch.me. 

If you've ever had a moment where you just cannot decide what to eat for lunch, this is the way to go! 

How it works
---
- You add in your own address (or city) and it will search through Yelp's API for all open restaurants near you.
- It will then proceed to extract every category that these restaurants are apart of. 
- You then choose which categories you'd want!
- Finally, you press "Choose Me" and it shall give you a random restaurant to order lunch from!


Technologies Used
---
- Express.js
- HTML/CSS (minimal.)
- Yelp API
- Glitch.me as a host.
